I just stumbled out of the theater after watching Revelations, and my brain feels like it’s gone through a washing machine cycle on spin. God, that film. It’s like someone took every color in the rainbow, threw it into a blender, and then just poured it straight into my eyeballs. I’m not even sure if I liked it or hated it. You ever see something so wild you just don’t know what to feel? That’s me right now.

The main character—what’s his face, Michael or something?—is like that overcooked bit of steak you think'll be dry as a desert but turns out surprisingly juicy, but you’re still not convinced it was worth the trip to the steakhouse. Or maybe he was undercooked? Can’t decide. He’s there for all the big moments, but somehow I remember the sidekick more. The guy who keeps complaining about his allergies? Yeah, him. Plot twist: he's allergic to plotlines that make sense.

> Honestly, it's like trudging through a swamp of emotions with no mosquito repellent. You’re getting bitten left and right by these weird existential thoughts. I sat there questioning my life choices like, why did I need that extra-large popcorn for this rollercoaster of chaos? 

There was this scene where the world was collapsing or something, which really felt like rush hour traffic, you know? Chaotic, but in a mesmerising way that makes you forget you’re stuck in it—until someone’s blaring their horn, pulling you back to reality. Or maybe that was the guy next to me who’d clearly had too much Coke. Who knows. By the way, if you download the movie (is that even legal?), good luck explaining it to your dog. Or to yourself. 

Here's a thing I jotted down in my phone while I was busy not knowing what to think:

```
if(worldCollapsing && characterStillRunning) {
    keepWatching();
} else {
    eatMorePopcorn();
}
```

And the ending. Wow. It hits you like when you walk into a glass door you thought was open. Sudden, confusing, slightly embarrassing. But you know what, maybe I’ll watch the movie again. Or maybe I'll just nap. Yup, I could totally nap.
